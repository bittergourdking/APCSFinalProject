After a heist gone wrong, art-conservator-turned-unwilling-con-artist Proserpine Claquesous escapes the city for the countryside. Now, they must lie low and make an honest living for themself, by tending to a small farm and running an eatery. The only problem? They canâ€™t cook. Or farm. Or do taxes. Help Proserpine plant, water, weed, and harvest their crops; take orders, prepare dishes, and beg for tips; and distract any pesky detectives that come to investigate!
